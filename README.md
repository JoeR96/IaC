AWS Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
This repository contains Terraform configuration files for deploying AWS resources, including an RDS instance and an ECS Fargate service. The infrastructure is set up using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles and best practices.

Prerequisites
Terraform (v1.1.0 or later)
AWS CLI (v2.0 or later)
An AWS account with the necessary access permissions
Repository Structure
main.tf: The main Terraform configuration file containing the AWS provider configuration
vpc.tf: Terraform configuration for creating a VPC and its associated resources
rds.tf: Terraform configuration for creating an RDS instance and security group
ecs.tf: Terraform configuration for creating an ECS Fargate service and related resources
variables.tf: Terraform variable definitions
.github/workflows/terraform.yml: GitHub Actions workflow for running Terraform commands
Getting Started
Clone the repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
cd your_repository
Configure AWS CLI

Copy code
aws configure
Enter your AWS access key, secret key, and default region when prompted.

Set up GitHub repository secrets

In your GitHub repository, navigate to the "Secrets" tab in the settings and add the following secrets:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Your AWS access key ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Your AWS secret access key
RDS_USERNAME: Your RDS instance master username
RDS_PASSWORD: Your RDS instance master password
Initialize Terraform

csharp
Copy code
terraform init
Validate Terraform configuration

Copy code
terraform validate
Plan infrastructure changes

Copy code
terraform plan
Review the proposed changes and ensure they match your expectations.

Apply infrastructure changes

arduino
Copy code
terraform apply -auto-approve
This command will create or update the infrastructure as needed.

Destroy infrastructure (optional)

To clean up the infrastructure when it's no longer needed, run:

arduino
Copy code
terraform destroy -auto-approve
Continuous Integration
This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically runs Terraform commands on the main branch. The workflow sets up Terraform, runs init, validate, plan, and apply commands, and passes the RDS username and password using GitHub repository secrets.
